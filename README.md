In a effort to make it easier to make alternative data structures compatable with DIGGS I am building realationship tables representing the various compenents of the DIGGS XML data sturcture. I built a tool to programmaticaly generat these tables from the XML Schema Definition files (.xsd). 

Check out the [Database Schema Relationships](https://dbdocs.io/ross.cutts/DIGGS_Schema?view=relationships) for the Geotechnical XML Schema Definition file.
