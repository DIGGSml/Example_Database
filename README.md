# Enhancing DIGGS Data Structure Compatibility

For a comprehensive understanding of the relationships within the Geotechnical XML Schema Definition, take a look at the [Database Schema Relationships](https://dbdocs.io/ross.cutts/DIGGS_Schema?view=relationships). We are building two example databases to demonstrate different approaches.

### 1. Simple Database Structure (Geosetta.org)
This example, donated by Geosetta.org, provides a great starting point for DIGGS compatibility. It includes various tools for importing, exporting, and visualizing DIGGS files. You can explore this simplified structure here: [Simple Database Structure](https://dbdocs.io/ross.cutts/Geosetta-Simple_example?schema=public&view=relationships&table=Point_Table).

### 2. Robust Database Structure (Nicholas, Miller)
Our second example offers a more comprehensive structure donated by Nicholas, designed to handle greater complexity while balancing flexibility and simplicity. This results in a larger number of tables but reduces complexity when importing, exporting, and generating data. Explore this robust example here: [Robust Database Structure](https://dbdiagram.io/d/DIGGS-SQL-Structure-668dcbd19939893dae7ebb48).

Both table structures can help you visualize different data storage methods and serve as a foundation for building your own custom implementations.

Feel free to explore the schema and contribute to further refining these data structures.
