Enhancing DIGGS Data Structure Compatibility

In an effort to make alternative data structures compatible with DIGGS (Data Interchange for Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists), I am developing relationship tables that represent the various components of the DIGGS XML data structure. To facilitate this, I've built a tool that programmatically generates these tables from XML Schema Definition files (.xsd). This approach aims to streamline the process of integrating diverse data formats with the DIGGS standard, enhancing interoperability and ease of use.

For a comprehensive view of the relationships within the Geotechnical XML Schema Definition, Check out the [Database Schema Relationships](https://dbdocs.io/ross.cutts/DIGGS_Schema?view=relationships). This visualization aids in understanding how different elements within the DIGGS schema are interconnected, providing valuable insights for developers and researchers working with geotechnical data.

Feel free to explore the schema and contribute to further refining these data structures.
